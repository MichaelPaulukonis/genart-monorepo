# Save-Selection Feature Summary

The Save-Selection feature enables Dragline artists to capture consistent, social-ready crops of their generative text compositions through a dedicated grid-aligned selection workflow. This addresses the need for artists publishing work to Instagram, blogs, and animation pipelines to export precise regions without leaving the application or relying on external cropping tools.

The implementation provides a comprehensive selection system activated via Shift+Alt+S that overlays an interactive crop rectangle on the canvas. Users can drag the selection area, resize it from corner/edge handles, and choose from 9 aspect ratio presets (Free, 1:1, 4:5, 3:4, 2:3, 16:9, 21:9, 9:16, 5:4) via clickable buttons in the overlay. The selection snaps to the underlying text grid, maintains session persistence for quick repeat captures, and integrates seamlessly with the existing save pipeline to export either cropped selections or full-canvas images. The UI employs a canvas overlay approach with semi-transparent masking outside the selection area, interactive handles for resizing, and a floating button array for ratio selection.

Key design decisions included choosing expansion over shrinking when applying ratio constraints to maintain content visibility, implementing hit-testing priority (ratio buttons > selection handles > block interactions) to prevent gesture conflicts, and using p5.js primitives for all UI elements to maintain consistency with the existing codebase. The feature includes comprehensive Jest test coverage for grid utilities and ratio functionality, with performance considerations addressed through selective redrawing and cached character grids.
