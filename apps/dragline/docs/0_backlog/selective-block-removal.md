# Selective Block Removal & Editing

## Idea
Introduce finer-grained control for managing individual text blocks.

## Notes
- Provide a delete action for the currently selected block (e.g., Delete/Backspace).
- Consider a dedicated selection mode navigated via keyboard for accessibility.
- Explore replace, clone, or edit flows once selection mechanics feel solid.
