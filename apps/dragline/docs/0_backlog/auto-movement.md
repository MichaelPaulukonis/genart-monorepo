# Auto Movement Studies

## Idea
Experiment with autonomous motion to animate the text landscape.

## Notes
- Consider gentle drift, orbiting clusters, or physics-inspired shuffles.
- Allow artists to toggle animation on/off to preserve compositions.
- Evaluate whether this feature belongs in core dragline or a spin-off sketch.
