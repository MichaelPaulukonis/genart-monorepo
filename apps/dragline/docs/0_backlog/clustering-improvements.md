# Clustering Improvements

## Idea
Refine how blocks spawn so clusters feel intentional yet surprising.

## Notes
- Tune spread radius to avoid unintended overlaps at initialization.
- Experiment with themed cluster patterns (spirals, radial bursts, gradients).
- Surface parameters for artists to tweak clustering intensity on the fly.
