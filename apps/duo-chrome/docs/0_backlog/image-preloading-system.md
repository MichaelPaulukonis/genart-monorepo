# Image Preloading System

## Overview
Implement intelligent image preloading to improve performance and eliminate loading delays during composition generation.

## Problem Statement
Current system loads images on-demand, causing delays and potential loading failures. With 160+ images, this creates performance bottlenecks.

## Potential Benefits
- Smoother user experience with instant image switching
- Reduced loading failures and error handling needs
- Better perceived performance
- Enables more complex features like rapid cycling

## Technical Considerations
- Progressive loading strategy (prioritize recently used images)
- Memory management for large image collection
- Loading progress indicators
- Fallback strategies for loading failures
- Caching strategies and cache invalidation

## Priority
High - Addresses core performance issues

## Dependencies
- None identified, but affects overall architecture

## Related Features
- Essential for smooth composition history browsing
- Would improve auto-generation experience
- Enables more responsive user interactions
