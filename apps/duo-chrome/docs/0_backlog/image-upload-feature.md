# Image Upload Feature

## Overview
Allow users to upload their own images to use in duotone compositions, expanding beyond the curated collection.

## Problem Statement
Currently users are limited to the ~160 curated images. Adding custom image upload would enable personalized compositions and broader creative exploration.

## Potential Benefits
- Personalized art creation with user's own photos/graphics
- Expanded creative possibilities beyond vintage imagery
- Increased user engagement and ownership of compositions

## Technical Considerations
- File upload handling (drag & drop, file picker)
- Image processing (resize, convert to B&W if needed)
- Memory management for user-uploaded images
- File format support (PNG, JPG, SVG?)
- Image validation and error handling

## Priority
Medium - Nice to have feature that would enhance user experience

## Dependencies
- None identified
