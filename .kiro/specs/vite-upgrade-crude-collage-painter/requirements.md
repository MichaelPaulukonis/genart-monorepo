# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The crude-collage-painter application is currently using Vite 2.7.2, while the rest of the monorepo has been upgraded to Vite 5.0. This creates inconsistency in the development environment and prevents the application from benefiting from Vite 5's improvements including better performance, enhanced HMR, and improved build optimizations. This upgrade will align crude-collage-painter with the monorepo's standard tooling.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Upgrade Vite Dependency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want crude-collage-painter to use Vite 5.0, so that it matches the monorepo's standard tooling and benefits from the latest features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package.json is updated THEN the vite dependency SHALL be changed from ^2.7.2 to ^5.0.0
2. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN Vite 5.0 SHALL be successfully installed without conflicts
3. WHEN the dev server is started THEN it SHALL run on port 5174 as configured

### Requirement 2: Update Vite Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the vite.config.js to be compatible with Vite 5, so that the application builds and runs correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the vite.config.js uses CommonJS syntax THEN it SHALL be converted to ES modules syntax
2. WHEN the configuration is loaded THEN it SHALL be compatible with Vite 5's API changes
3. WHEN the server.fs.allow configuration is present THEN it SHALL continue to work or be updated to Vite 5's equivalent
4. WHEN the build configuration is present THEN it SHALL maintain the same output structure

### Requirement 3: Maintain Existing Functionality

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing features to continue working after the upgrade, so that no functionality is lost.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dev server runs THEN the application SHALL load and function correctly
2. WHEN the build command runs THEN it SHALL produce a working production build
3. WHEN the GitHub Pages deployment runs THEN it SHALL deploy successfully with the correct base path
4. WHEN the application runs THEN all p5.js sketches, file operations, and UI controls SHALL work as before

### Requirement 4: Verify Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to ensure all dependencies are compatible with Vite 5, so that there are no runtime or build errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dependencies are analyzed THEN any incompatibilities with Vite 5 SHALL be identified
2. WHEN the application is tested THEN there SHALL be no console errors related to the Vite upgrade
3. WHEN the build process runs THEN there SHALL be no deprecation warnings or errors
